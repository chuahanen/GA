[Project 1 - Python + Pokemon Data] Students will demonstrate command of basic Python data structures, implement Python syntax for control log functions, and calculate descriptive statistics.

[Project 2 - EDA + Double Datasets] Students will analyze SAT and drug use datasets & explicitly state their assumptions. They will form hypotheses and justify them with solid statistical testing in NumPy, while visualizing and interpreting their plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

[Project 3 - Regression + Housing Data] Students will review the Ames housing dataset & explicitly state their assumptions. Then they will clean, impute, and explore the dataset, justifying their modeling choices and any feature engineering. 

[Project 4 - Web Scraping + Job Data] Students will scrape and prepare their own data, then create and compare at least two models for each section: an ensemble model or decision tree, and a classifier or regression model.
